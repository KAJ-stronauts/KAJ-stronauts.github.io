Today, we worked on our Pine View Fair booth. We started putting together tests for students of different grade levels. Students will take the test in an allotted amount of time and get prizes based on how well above the standard deviation that they do. [Programming Club](http://monolc.com/PVPClub.html) will also be using some of our booth space to host Wikipedia races wherein two people compete to get from one Wikipedia page the fastest.

Hopefully, next meeting we will work some on  the oscillatory motion machine and the twin primes problem.
