Today, we worked on a whole bunch of puzzles. It was fun. We're going to pick back up with the Devil's Chessboard puzzle in the future, maybe next meeting.

Speaking of next meeting, it's not going to be next week because of Thanksgiving break. So, we'll be meeting the week after that at the same time as usual. See you Thursday, 4 December at 1pm.
