Hey all, there's no meeting this week of 5â€“9 January.

Due to Moody's, we're going to have to move meetings to Mondays until the beginning of March, assuming this works for Dr. Jukes. I'll keep you all posted as I get confirmation of this.

Personally, I'm looking forward to Dr. Covert struggling with the pronunciation of *KAJ-stronauts*.

Oh! Also! We have a new feature: an attendance tracker. Just head over to [kajstronauts.com/attendance](http://kajstronauts.com/attendance/) whenever you attend the club and fill the form out. It'll help me keep things organized.

Cheers!
