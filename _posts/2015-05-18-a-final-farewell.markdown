And as that, KAJ-stronauts has come to an end. Today marked the final KAJ-stronauts meeting that will likely ever be held. 

I'd like to thank Dr. Jukes for so graciously hosting us and putting up with our generally nerdy shenanigans. Additionally, I'd like to thank all of KAJ-stronauts members and attendees for actually showing up, and showing up with remarkable consistency. Also, props to Parker Mason for coming up with the name *KAJ-stronauts*.

This final school year has been a blast for me, and KAJ-stronauts was truly a highlight of that. I'm honored that I got to spend my time doing what I love with truly amazing people.

To those of you embarking on new journeys, our seniors and Dr. Jukes, godspeed and best of luck. To those of you continuing current journeys, our sophomores and juniors, may you stay the course and weather the storms.

I'm sure all of you will go on to do yet more great things.

Live long and prosper,  
Zackary Corbett, President KAJ-stronauts
