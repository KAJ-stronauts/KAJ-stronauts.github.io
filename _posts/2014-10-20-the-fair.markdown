So, the Pine View Fair was last Saturday. Overall, the joint booth between KAJ-stronauts and Programming Club did phenomenally. Between the math quizzes and Dr. Juke's fantastic math tricks, we raised an estimated $55. Unless anyone has an idea of what to do with that money, we'll probably put it toward food.

Thanks to everyone to came and helped. So many of you showed up to help out, it was really fantastic.

As I said previously, I won't be at Pine View for the next meeting, but Caleb Proffitt will be leading the meeting, so please still show up. Have fun!
