This was our seventh meeting! Seven is a  prime number!

Today we relaxed and played mathematic hangman until 1:30 whereupon we went to a guest lecture being held at Pine View about quantum mechanics. It was really quite interesting and science-y.

## Next Week

We'll actually start to dig into some real mathematics, as Dr. Jukes is going to talk about twin primes.
