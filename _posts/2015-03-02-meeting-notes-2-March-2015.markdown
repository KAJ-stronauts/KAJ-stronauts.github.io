Today, I talked to everyone about the [Moody's Mega Math Challenge (M^3)][M3]. I went over the process a bit and talk about our paper and the model. It was pretty fun. Hopefully, I'll put the paper on our website in the weeks to come.

Also, we agreed that Mondays were working better for everyone and that, now that Moody's is over, we're not going to switch back to Thursdays. Nifty.
