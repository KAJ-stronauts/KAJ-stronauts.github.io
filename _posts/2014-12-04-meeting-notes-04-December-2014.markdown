Today we finished up looking at the Devil's Chessboard problem. We learned a decent bit about [parity bits][parity bits] (terrible pun intended). Proffitt generalized a chessboard as an eight-dimensional hypercube because he's cool like that.

Simultaneously, we worked on building Dr. Juke's simple harmonic motion machine. If you'd like to know more about this project, here's [a link to a *paywalled* paper on it that Dr. Jukes coauthored][oscillating bar].

Enjoy this photo of some of the KAJ-stronauts working on the machine.

Lastly, a few of us discussed Moody's Mega Math Challenge teams.

By the way, a Pine View alumn and Electronic Arts developer is coming to speak to kids at Pine View tomorrow, Friday, 5 December during eight period in Mr. Goebel's room. You should come, it'd be cool.
