And as that, KAJ-stronauts has come to an end. Today marked the final KAJ-stronauts meeting that will likely ever be held.

To commemorate the event, we donated [the $54.56 KAJ-stronauts raised at the Pine View Fair](/notes/2014/10/30/meeting-notes-30-October-2014.html) to the Anthony Grebe scholarship. In true KAJ-stronauts style, we presented Dr. Jukes with a shoddily made, but heartfelt decorative check.

We finished out the day by playing [Jotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto), per Alex Sosa's suggestion. A fantastic way to end the club.
