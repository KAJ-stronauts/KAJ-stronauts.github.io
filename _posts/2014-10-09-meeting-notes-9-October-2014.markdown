Today, we tried to finalize the tests for the fair and Caleb presented his project for displaying statistics. We're mostly done with everything. Hopefully, next week we'll start work on the simple harmonic motion machine.

Also, we taught some of the members calculus in an absolutely terrible way that defies all the laws of calculus but sort of worked if you didn't think about it too much. Sorry, Mr. Nezelek.
