Today, attendance was surprisingly low â€” there was even part of a doughnut left over; we only had five members total show up. Ilya, Dr. Jukes, and I worked on finishing the second revision of the simple harmonic motion machine. That was about it.

Maybe next week, Shawn, Mimi, and I will work on proofing Thomas' differential equation for the simple harmonic motion machine.
