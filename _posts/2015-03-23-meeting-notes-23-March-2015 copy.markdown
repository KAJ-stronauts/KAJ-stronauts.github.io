Today, we had a pretty easy day, but we solved a few fun math challenges that I cam up with for the class.

This first challenge was to write a non-peacewise function which output 1 when an integer was plugged into it, and 0 when a non-integer was inputted into it.

This second challenge was to write a non-peacewise function which output 3x when an even integer, x, was plugged into it, x when an odd integer, x, was plugged into it, and an imaginary number when any non-integer was inputted into it.

If you feel like doing the challenges, let me know your solutions at <zackary@corbett.im>.
